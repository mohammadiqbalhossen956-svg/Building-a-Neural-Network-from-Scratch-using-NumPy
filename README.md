# Deep Learning from Scratch: Titanic Survival Prediction using NumPy

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a deep understanding of Neural Network fundamentals by building an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** from scratch. Instead of using high-level frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, I implemented the core mathematical logic using only **NumPy**.

## Key Technical Features
* **Manual Architecture:** Designed a single-neuron architecture incorporating weights and bias initialization.
* **Forward & Backpropagation:** Programmed the forward pass and gradient descent-based backpropagation algorithm manually to minimize loss.
* **Activation Function:** Implemented the **Sigmoid** activation function for binary classification.
* **Data Engineering:** Used `StandardScaler` to normalize features, ensuring optimal convergence during training.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Core Logic:** NumPy
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, Scikit-Learn
* **Environment:** Developed on **Pydroid 3**

## Project Performance
* **Test Accuracy:** Successfully achieved an accuracy of **~75% (0.7483)** on the Titanic dataset, comparable to high-level ML libraries.
